// Stub file for compatibility - database extensions functionality moved to individual API services
// This maintains compatibility with existing imports

// This file previously extended DatabaseService with additional methods
// Those methods are now implemented in the individual service files (campaigns.ts, etc.)
// This stub file prevents import errors while the system uses the new API-based services

export {}; // Empty export to make this a valid module
